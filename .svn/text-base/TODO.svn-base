Concentrate on writing PPU

PPU subtasks:

1. Colour
2. Sprites
3. Scrolling

Try per-pixel rendering

Write file reader.

Have CPU opcode data loaded from file, depends on file reader.

ROM loading should be done through file reader.

Change mapper to read ROM PRG banks from ROM, instead of copying banks into cpu mem. It will save memory.

Implement timer, with accurate cycle allocation (NTSC)

Mirroring isn't working correctly. Sort it out in ROM.h - done, except for SINGLE_SCREEN_MIRRORING and FOUR_SCREEN_MIRRORING.

SCROLLING, SCROLLING, SCROLLING!!!

Setup correct palette mirroring

Do PPU mirroring, can't put this off any longer.
